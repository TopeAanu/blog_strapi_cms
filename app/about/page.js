      <p className="mb-4">
        Strapi is an open-source headless CMS designed to make content
        management simple, flexible, and developer-friendly. Built with Node.js,
        it allows developers to create customizable APIs quickly using a modern
        admin panel and intuitive content structure.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Strapi supports both REST and GraphQL, making it easy to integrate with
        frontend frameworks like React, Vue, or Next.js. One of its key
        strengths is extensibilityâ€”you can define custom content types, roles,
        and permissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also stores data in popular databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or
        MySQL. Whether you're building a blog, e-commerce platform, or corporate
        site, Strapi empowers developers to manage content with full control.
